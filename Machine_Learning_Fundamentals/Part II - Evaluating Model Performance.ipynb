    "We now have a function that can predict the price for any living space we want to list as long as we know the number of people it can accommodate. The function we wrote represents a **machine learning model**, which means that it outputs a prediction based on the input to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to test the quality of your model is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- split the dataset into 2 partitions:\n",
    "    - the training set: contains the majority of the rows (75%)\n",
    "    - the test set: contains the remaining minority of the rows (25%)\n",
    "- use the rows in the training set to predict the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">price</span> value for the rows in the test set\n",
    "    - add new column named <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">predicted_price</span> to the test set\n",
    "- compare the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">predicted_price</span> values with the actual  <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">price</span> values in the test set to see how accurate the predicted values were.\n",
    "\n",
    "This validation process, where we use the training set to make predictions and the test set to predict values for, is known as **train/test validation**. Whenever you're performing machine learning, you want to perform validation of some kind to ensure that your machine learning model can make good predictions on new data. While train/test validation isn't perfect, we'll use it to understand the validation process, to select an error metric, and then we'll dive into a more robust validation process later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's modify the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">predicted_price</span> function to use only the rows in the training set, instead of the full dataset, to find the nearest neighbors, average the <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">price</span> values for those rows, and return the predicted price value. Then, we'll use this function to predict the price for just the rows in the test set. Once we have the predicted price values, we can compare with the true price values and start to understand the model's effectiveness in the next screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we've gone ahead and assigned the first 75% of the rows in <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">dc_listings</span> to <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">train_df</span> and the last 25% of the rows to <span style=\"background-color: #F9EBEA; color:##C0392B\">test_df</span>.

    "While the MAE (7.5) to RMSE (7.9056941504209481) ratio was about 1:1 for the first list of errors, the MAE (62.5) to RMSE (235.82302686548658) ratio was closer to 1:4 for the second list of errors. The only difference between the 2 sets of errors is the extreme 1000 value in errors_two instead of 10. When we're working with larger data sets, we can't inspect each value to understand if there's one or some outliers or if all of the errors are systematically higher. Looking at the ratio of MAE to RMSE can help us understand if there are large but infrequent errors. You can read more about comparing MAE and RMSE in [this wonderful post](https://medium.com/human-in-a-machine-world/mae-and-rmse-which-metric-is-better-e60ac3bde13d#.lyc8od1ix).\n",

    "In this mission, we learned how to test our machine learning models using basic cross validation and different metrics. In the next 2 missions, we'll explore how adding more features to the machine learning model and selecting a more optimal k value can help improve the model's performance."
